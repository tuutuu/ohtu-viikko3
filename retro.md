##Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel

10 minutes of meta process discussion.

Team draws a circle and divides it into 5 sections with the following keywords:

Start - what should we start doing, what haven't we done yet?

Stop - what should we stop doing, what is not contributing to our project?

Continue - what is currently working and should be continued?

More of - what would work but we aren't doing enough of?

Less of - what is not as important as we thought?

Comments are encouraged and divided into these sections.

##Glad, Sad, Mad

Participants write notes on small index cards. Participants very briefly describe their cards and place them on a whiteboard. This is just so that other participants understand what the content means.

Whiteboard is divided into 3 columns: Glad, Sad and Mad

Cards are divided into these categories, based on how the issues described on them made the participant feel.

Cards related on similar issues are grouped together. This is done by a single person and should be quick.

Each person votes for up to 5 cards that they wish to discuss further.

Someone acts as the chair of the restrospective and leads a discussion:
in descending order of the amount of votes, the issues are discussed.

The restrospective typically ends when 60 minutes have passed. This means the most important issues are discussed the most.
